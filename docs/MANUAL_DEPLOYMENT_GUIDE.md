# ðŸš€ Manual Deployment Guide - Real Estate System

## Quick Deploy to Your Salesforce Org

Since the automated deployment isn't working, let's deploy the Real Estate system manually. This will show you both approaches!

### Method 1: Using Salesforce CLI (Recommended)

**Step 1: Open PowerShell in your project directory**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Kaleem Azam\Desktop\Salesforce Dev Workflow 16 june 2025\SalesforceDevWorkflow"
```

**Step 2: Authenticate to your org**
```bash
sf org login web --alias MyOrg
```
- This will open your browser
- Log into your Salesforce org: https://cloudseek-dev-ed.develop.lightning.force.com
- Authorize the CLI

**Step 3: Deploy the Property object first**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir "force-app/main/default/objects/Property__c" --target-org MyOrg
```

**Step 4: Deploy the Client object**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir "force-app/main/default/objects/Client__c" --target-org MyOrg
```

**Step 5: Deploy the Apex classes**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir "force-app/main/default/classes" --target-org MyOrg
```

**Step 6: Deploy the tabs**
```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir "force-app/main/default/tabs" --target-org MyOrg
```

### Method 2: Manual Creation in Salesforce (If CLI doesn't work)

### Method 3: Use Workbench (Web-based deployment)

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify everything works:

2. You should see "Property" and "Client" objects

1. Click App Launcher (9 dots)
2. You should see "Properties" and "Clients" tabs

2. Fill out a sample property
3. Save and verify it works

2. You should get an error message

## Troubleshooting

**If you get permission errors:**
- Make sure you're logged in as System Administrator
- Check that your user has "Modify All Data" permission

**If objects don't appear:**
- Refresh your browser
- Check Setup â†’ Object Manager to confirm deployment

**If tabs don't show:**
- Go to Setup â†’ Apps â†’ App Manager
- Edit your app and add the new tabs

## Quick Test Script

Once deployed, test with this sample data:

**Property 1:**
- Name: Luxury Downtown Condo
- Address: 123 Main Street
- Price: $750,000
- Property Type: Condo
- Status: Available
- Bedrooms: 2
- Bathrooms: 2.5
- Square Feet: 1800

**Client 1:**
- Name: John Smith
- Email: john.smith@email.com

- Client Type: Buyer

## Success Indicators

âœ… You can create Property records
âœ… You can create Client records

âœ… Tabs appear in your app
âœ… Fields display correctly

Once this is working, you'll have a complete Real Estate Management System in your Salesforce org!

## Next Steps

After manual deployment:
1. Test all functionality
2. Create sample data
3. Explore the automation features
4. Ask Cursor AI to add more features

The manual approach shows you exactly what the CI/CD pipeline does automatically - but the pipeline is 100x faster and safer!

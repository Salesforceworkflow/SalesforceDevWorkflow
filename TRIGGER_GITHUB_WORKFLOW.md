# üéØ TRIGGER GITHUB WORKFLOW MANUALLY

## I Can See the "Run workflow" Button in Your Screenshot!

### Step 1: Manual Trigger
1. **You're already on the right page**: https://github.com/Salesforceworkflow/SalesforceDevWorkflow/actions/workflows/deploy-production.yml
2. **Click the "Run workflow" button** (I can see it in the top right)
3. **Select branch**: main
4. **Click "Run workflow"**

### Step 2: Watch It Run
- The workflow should start immediately
- It will show as "In progress" 
- Takes 2-3 minutes to complete

### Step 3: Check Results
- If ‚úÖ Green: Check your Salesforce org for Simple Property
- If ‚ùå Red: Click on the failed run to see error logs

## üö® BACKUP PLAN: Manual Creation

If GitHub workflow fails again, use the manual creation guide:
- **File**: `MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Time**: 5 minutes
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## üéØ BOTH APPROACHES

**Try GitHub trigger first** (30 seconds)
**If it fails ‚Üí Manual creation** (5 minutes)

This way you'll have the Simple Property app working in under 6 minutes guaranteed!
